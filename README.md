# API Wars

## Story

Because you are so awesome, a golden humanoid droid wants to meet you in the nearest Kantina.

[Watch this intro!](https://starwarsintrocreator.kassellabs.io/?ref=redirect#!/BM1kT5Ezi0Q0b-Ell8TE)

Your task is to create a web application that shows data about the Star Wars
universe, stores visitor preferences with cookies, and handles user login with
sessions.

## What are you going to learn?

- Use AJAX for API requests.
- Understand session handling.
- Store passwords.

## Tasks

1. Create a web server rendering a page that shows a table with all the planets in the Star Wars universe using `nodejs` and `express` in the backend, and `react` in the frontend.
    - The opening page of the website (`/`) shows the data of 10 planets.
    - The data is represented in a table which is fully responsive (arranged into a list on smaller viewports).
    - The columns of the table are `name`, `diameter` (shown in km), `climate`, `terrain`, `surface water` (shown as percentage), and `population` (formatted as `1,000,000 people`).
    - The column titles are proper table headers.
    - The page adheres to the following basic design.

    - There is a next button above the table, clicking it shows the next 10 planets, if any.
    - There is a previous button above the table, clicking it shows the previous 10 planets, if any.
    - Double clicking the next or previous buttons shows the next or previous 10 planets only once.
    - Unknown values for surface water percentage and population are stated clearly and without any suffix (for example those for planet Coruscant and Hoth).

2. Display a button in each row if the planet has residents. These buttons open a modal and populate its data, containing the list of residents with more detailed information.
    - In the planet table, there is a button in each row in a new column, showing the number of residents if the planet has any, otherwise the `No known residents` text is shown.
    - Clicking the `<n> residents` button in the planet table, a modal is displayed, showing all the residents of the planet (every time).
    - The modal has an HTML `<table>` element containing the data.
    - The columns of the table are `name`, `height` (shown in meters), `mass` (shown in kg), `skin color`, `hair color`, `eye color`, `birth year`, and `gender` (with an icon representation).
    - Data is loaded into the table without refreshing the page (with AJAX).
    - There is an X icon in the top right corner and a `Close` button in the bottom right corner; clicking these closes the modal.
    - The modal adheres to the following basic design.

3. Create a simple user login system with a registration page, a login page, and a logout link in the header, using Passport.js Google OAuth.
    - There is a link in the header that leads to the registration page.
    - On the registration page (`/register` route), a username and password pair can be created that gets stored in the database.
    - Password storage and retrieval uses salted password hashing for maximum security.
    - If either field is empty while clicking the `Submit` button on the registration page, the `Please, fill in both fields.` error message is displayed.
    - If the username field contains a username that already exists in the database while clicking the `Submit` button on the registration page, the `Username already exists, please choose another one!` error message is displayed.
    - On successful registration, the `Successful registration. Log in to continue.` text is displayed, and the user is redirected to the login page.
    - There is a link in the header that leads to the login page.
    - On the login page (`/login` route), visitors can log in using the previously created username and password.
    - If the username and password pair does not match while clicking the `Submit` button on the login page, the `Wrong username or password.` error message is displayed.
    - After logging in, the username is displayed in the top right corner with the text `Signed in as <username>` and a logout link is displayed in the header.
    - Clicking the logout link (`/logout` route) logs the user out.

4. [OPTIONAL] If the user is logged in, display a button in each row with which the logged in user can vote on a planet. Save this vote in a database and inform the user that the vote is saved.
    - If the user is logged in, a `Vote` button is displayed in the planet table in a new column.
    - Clicking the vote button saves the vote in the database without refreshing the page (with AJAX).
    - If the save is successful, after clicking the vote button, the `Voted on planet <planetname> successfully.` message is displayed.
    - If the save fails after clicking the vote button, the `There was an error during voting on planet <planetname>.` error message is displayed.
    - Users can vote on an unlimited number of planets and with an unlimited number of votes on a planet.

5. [OPTIONAL] Create a new modal window, accessible from the main page, where you display the statistics about voted planets.
    - There is a link in the header that opens a modal showing voting statistics based on the user votes saved in the database.
    - The modal is represented in a table which is fully responsive (arranged into a list on smaller viewports).
    - The columns of the table are `Planet name` and `Received votes`.
    - Data is loaded into the table without refreshing the page (with AJAX).
    - There is an X icon in the top right corner and a `Close` button in the bottom right corner; clicking these closes the modal.
    - The modal adheres to the following basic design.

6. [OPTIONAL] Make some improvements to make the web application easier to use.
    - The planet list displays a loading indicator while the content is loading.
    - Planet list navigation is disabled while the requested data is loading.
    - The residents modal displays a loading indicator while the content is loading.
    - The residents modal does not show the table header until the content is loaded.
    - If a UI framework is used (Bootstrap, Material-UI, and so on), the default theme is personalized for the project.

## General requirements

- For the whole assignment, get the data using [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).
- The page does not show a server error anytime during the review.

## Hints

- The starting repository is empty on purpose.


- Use a `<h1>` tag for the page heading.
- Add buttons for navigating between chunks of data (loading all planets would
  take too much resources, so SWAPI implements a pagination. Just look into its
  response, it has a `next` and a `previous` attribute).
- Use a bordered table to display the needed information.
- You are not required to use AJAX for the base page data. If you like, you can
  use the back-end for parts of the data processing (like the planet list), BUT
  the modal windows **must** load by calling an API with AJAX. This API can be
  SWAPI directly, or you can write a proxy in your web-server. When using Bootstrap, the
  "[Varying modal content based on trigger
  button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/modal/#via-javascript)"
  section of the Bootstrap documentation might help a lot.
- Use sessions for the login system.
- Use JSON to send data from the server side to the client side with AJAX.
- Use a data schema based on the following example for the login system and voting tasks.
  - `users` table
    - `id` : serial, primary key
    - `username` : unique name for users - varchar
    - `password` : hashed password - varchar
  - `planet-votes` table
    - `id` : serial, primary key
    - `planet_id` : integer (id from SWAPI data)
    - `planet_name` : varchar
    - `user_id` : integer, foreign_key
    - `submission_time` : datetime
